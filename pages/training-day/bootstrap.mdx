# Bootstrap

## A Brief History

Bootstrap was created by Twitter in mid-2010 by `@mdo` and `@fat`. Before becoming the open-sourced framework, Bootstrap was known as Twitter Blueprint.

While being a few months into development, Twitter held its first Hack Week, many developers of all levels jumped on twitter without any guidance, and the project exploded. This helped massively the small team of developers working on Bootstrap.

Bootstrap was released on Friday, August 19, 2011, and it's had over twenty releases, two major rewrites with `v2` and `v3`.

Bootstrap 4 saw once again a rewrite of the project, this time accounting for Sass and the move to CSS's flexbox.

Bootstrap 5 is the latest release, focusing on improving v4's codebase with as few breaking changes as possible.

## The Grid System

Bootstrap's Grid System is built around breakpoints, and follows a mobile first approach, this means that the aim is for Bootstrap to apply the bare minimum of styles to make a layout work at the smallest breakpoint, layering on styles for larger devices.
This ensures a better rendering time and a great experience for users.

Bootsraps breakpoints are:

| Breakpoint           | Class infix | Dimensions |
|----------------------|-------------|------------|
| Extra small          | None        | < 576px    |
| Small                | `sm`        | >= 576px   |
| Medium               | `md`        | >=768px    |
| Large                | `lg`        | >= 992px   |
| Extra large          | `xl`        | >= 1200px  |
| Extra extra large    | `xxl`       | >= 1400px  |

Breakpoints are representative of a subset of common device sizes and viewport dimensions.
