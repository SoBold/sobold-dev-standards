# npm Packages

This page provides an overview of the npm packages required for the [Core](/setup/core-profile) profile, especially for tasks like linting. These packages need to be installed globally to ensure proper functionality across all projects.

## EditorConfig

EditorConfig is a tool that helps maintain consistent coding styles across different editors and IDEs by defining coding conventions, such as indentation, line endings, and character encoding, in a configuration file (`.editorconfig`).

### Installation

To install `editorconfig` globally run:

```sh
npm i -g editorconfig
```

You can verify the installation by running:

```sh
npm list -g editorconfig
```

## Next steps

After installing the npm packages, head over to the [dotfiles](/setup/dotfiles) page to configure and manage the necessary dotfiles.
