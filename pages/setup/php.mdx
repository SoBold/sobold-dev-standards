# PHP and Composer Installation and Configuration

This page provides instructions for installing and configuring PHP and Composer. Follow the steps according to your operating system.

The primary goal is to install PHP and Composer. To achieve this, Homebrew (for macOS) or Winget (for Windows) will be required to facilitate the installation process of PHP and Composer.

## Install PHP

To install PHP, follow the instructions based on your operating system.

<Tabs items={['macOS', 'Windows']}>
    <Tabs.Tab label="macOS">
        ```sh
        brew install php
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab label="Windows">
        ```sh
        winget install php
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Install Composer

Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. To install Composer, follow the guide provided on the [Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

For manual installation through the command line, use:

<Tabs items={['macOS', 'Windows']}>
    <Tabs.Tab label="macOS">
        ```sh
        brew install composer
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab label="Windows">
        ```sh
        winget install composer
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Verify Installation

Confirm that PHP and Composer are correctly installed by checking their versions. This ensures that the installation was successful and both tools are available for use.

```sh
php -v
```

```sh
composer -v
```

Both commands should output the version number of the corresponding tool.

## PHP Versions

PHP versions follow a structured release cycle:
- **Active Support**: PHP versions are actively maintained with bug fixes and security updates.
- **Security Fixes Only**: PHP versions receive only security updates but no new features or bug fixes.
- **End of Life**: PHP versions that no longer receive updates.

Production applications should only use PHP versions that are under **Active Support** or **Security Fixes Only**.
