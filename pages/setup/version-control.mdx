# Setting Up Git

## Introduction

This guide provides instructions for installing and configuring Git on Windows and macOS.

## Install Git

### Installation on Windows

Go to [Git Download for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and follow the Winget instructiongs.

The command should be:
```bash
winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
```

### Installation on macOS

For macOS run:
```bash
brew install git
```

For Macs running macOS Sierra or higher that have the latest homebrew there won't be other steps required, brew will make sure that the latest version of Git is being used even if other git versions are installed.

### Verify installation

To verify the installation simply run:
```bash
git -v
```

You should see the Git version number displayed.

If after updating Git the version still shows as the old one, reinstantiate the terminal to refresh the environment.
