# Setting Up Git

## Introduction

This guide provides instructions for installing and configuring Git on Windows and macOS.

## Install Git

### Installation on Windows

Go to [Git Download for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and follow the Winget instructiongs.

The command should be:
```bash
winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
```

### Installation on macOS

For macOS run:
```bash
brew install git
```

For Macs running macOS Sierra or higher that have the latest homebrew there won't be other steps required, brew will make sure that the latest version of Git is being used even if other git versions are installed.

### Verify installation

To verify the installation simply run:
```bash
git -v
```

You should see the Git version number displayed.

<Callout>
If after updating Git the version still shows as the old one, reinstantiate the terminal to refresh the environment.
</Callout>

## Initial Git Configuration

Git stores its configuration in three levels: **system** (varies by system), **global** (`~/.gitconfig`), and **local** (`.git/config` in each repository). System settings apply to all users, global settings apply to the current user, and local settings apply to individual repositories.

<Callout type="info">
System configuration is usually found where Git is installed, such as /opt/homebrew/etc/gitconfig for Homebrew, and can be ignored.
</Callout>

The local Git configuration should never be modified, as it is specific to the repository and managed by the repository owner.

<Callout type="info">
To find configuration rules and their locations, run git config --list --show-origin in the terminal.
</Callout>

### Global configuration

<Callout type="warning">
Remember to update the name and email settings to your own.
</Callout>

To modify the global Git configuration, open `~/.gitconfig` in a text editor using `code ~/.gitconfig` and paste the following configuration:

```ini
[user]
    name = [your-name]
    email = [github-account-email]
[init]
    defaultBranch = main
[core]
    autocrlf = input
    fscache = true
    symlinks = false
    editor = code --wait
[pull]
    rebase = true
[fetch]
    prune = true
[filter "lfs"]
    clean = git-lfs clean -- %f
    smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f
    process = git-lfs filter-process
    required = true
[diff]
    tool = vscode
    colorMoved = zebra
[difftool "vscode"]
    cmd = code --wait --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE
[diff "astextplain"]
    textconv = astextplain
```
