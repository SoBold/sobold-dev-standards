# Node.js Installation and Configuration

This page provides instructions for installing and configuring Node.js and npm. Follow the steps according to your operating system.

The primary goal is to install Node.js. To achieve this, Homebrew (for macOS) or Winget (for Windows) will be required to facilitate the installation process of Node.js and its package manager, npm.

## Install Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS. Install it by running the command provided on the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh) in your terminal. This will set up Homebrew and allow you to manage software installations easily.

## Install winget

<Callout>
Winget on Windows 10 & 11 comes pre installed as part of the App Installer
</Callout>

Winget is a package manager for Windows. Install it by following the instructions on the [Windows Package Manager website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/). This will enable you to install and manage software via the command line.

## Install fnm

A guide to the installation process can be found in [fnm Github page](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

For manual installation through command line, use:

<Tabs items={['macOS', 'Windows']}>
    <Tabs.Tab label="macOS">
        ```sh
        brew install fnm
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab label="Windows">
        ```sh
        winget install Schniz.fnm
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Install Node

To install Node LTS run the following command:

```sh
fnm install --lts
```

To list all the installed versions of Node installed with `fnm`, use:

```sh
fnm ls
```

To use a specific installed version, use:

```sh
fnm use 18
```

### Verify installation

Confirm that Node.js and npm are correctly installed by checking their versions. This ensures that the installation was successful and both tools are available for use.

```sh
node -v
```

```sh
npm -v
```

Both commands should output the version number of the corresponding tool.

### Node.js Releases

Node.js versions enter `Current` release status for six months, allowing time for library updates.\
Odd-numbered versions (7, 9, 11) become unsupported after six months, while even-numbered versions (8, 10, 12) shift to `Active LTS`, providing long-term support and critical bug fixes for up to 30 months.
Production applicationns should only use `Active LTS` or `Maintenance LTS` releases.

### Release Schedule

For detailed release schedules, visit the [Node.js GitHub page](https://github.com/nodejs/Release).
