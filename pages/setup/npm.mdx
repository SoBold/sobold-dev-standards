# Node.js Installation and Configuration

## Introduction

This page provides instructions for installing and configuring Node.js and npm. Follow the steps according to your operating system.

The primary goal is to install Node.js. To achieve this, Homebrew (for macOS) or Winget (for Windows) will be required to facilitate the installation process of Node.js and its package manager, npm.

## Install Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS. Install it by running the command provided on the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh) in your terminal. This will set up Homebrew and allow you to manage software installations easily.

<Callout type="info">
Remember to add `brew` to your `PATH` by following the instructions provided by Homebrew in the terminal after installation.
</Callout>

Confirm that Brew is correctly installed by checking its version.

```sh
brew -v
```

## Install Oh My ZSH (optional)


## Install winget

<Callout>
Winget on Windows 10 & 11 comes pre installed as part of the App Installer
</Callout>

Winget is a package manager for Windows. Install it by following the instructions on the [Windows Package Manager website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/). This will enable you to install and manage software via the command line.

## Install fnm

A guide to the installation process can be found in [fnm Github page](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

For manual installation through command line, use:

<Tabs items={['macOS', 'Windows']}>
    <Tabs.Tab label="macOS">
        ```sh
        brew install fnm
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab label="Windows">
        ```sh
        winget install Schniz.fnm
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

After installing `fnm` continue following the fnm installation page to setup the environment variables.
This is done by evaluating the output of `fnm env`.

<Callout type="info">
Check out the [Configuration](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm/blob/master/docs/configuration.md) section and enable all the highly recommended features.
</Callout>

## Install Node

To install Node LTS run the following command:

```sh
fnm install --lts
```

To list all the installed versions of Node installed with `fnm`, use:

```sh
fnm ls
```

To use a specific installed version, use:

```sh
fnm use 18
```

### Verify installation

Confirm that Node.js and npm are correctly installed by checking their versions. This ensures that the installation was successful and both tools are available for use.

```sh
node -v
```

```sh
npm -v
```

Both commands should output the version number of the corresponding tool.

## Node.js Releases

Node.js versions enter `Current` release status for six months, allowing time for library updates.\
Odd-numbered versions (7, 9, 11) become unsupported after six months, while even-numbered versions (8, 10, 12) shift to `Active LTS`, providing long-term support and critical bug fixes for up to 30 months.
Production applicationns should only use `Active LTS` or `Maintenance LTS` releases.

### Release Schedule

For detailed release schedules, visit the [Node.js GitHub page](https://github.com/nodejs/Release).


## Core

This section provides an overview of the npm required for the [Core](/setup/core-profile) profile, especially for tasks like linting. These packages need to be installed globally to ensure proper functionality across all projects. If you haven't completed the steps necessary to install Node and npm please go to the [top of the page](#introduction)

### EditorConfig

EditorConfig is a tool that helps maintain consistent coding styles across different editors and IDEs by defining coding conventions, such as indentation, line endings, and character encoding, in a configuration file (`.editorconfig`).

#### Installation

To install `editorconfig` globally run:

```sh
npm i -g editorconfig
```

You can verify the installation by running:

```sh
npm list -g editorconfig
```

### Next steps

Head back to the [Core page](/setup/core-profile/#prerequisites) to finish configuring the necessary prerequisites for Core Profile.
