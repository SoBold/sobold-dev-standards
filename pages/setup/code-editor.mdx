Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is the IDE of choice for the company. This guide explains how to set up VS Code and import a profile from a GitHub Gist using the Profile Importer.

## Install Visual Studio Code

Visit the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and go to the download page. Download the installer for your operating system, and run it following the installation instructions.

## Setup

After installing VS Code not much is left in terms of setup.

### Launching from the command line

VS Code can be run from the terminal by typing 'code'.
Windows users should be able to do this straight after the installation.
MacOS users will be able to use this feature after adding `code` to the path:

- Launch VS Code.
- Open the *Command Palette* (`⌘+⇧+P`) and type 'shell command' to find *Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH* command.
- Restart the terminal for the new `$PATH` value to take effect. You'll be able to type 'code .' in any folder to start editing files in that folder.

```sh
