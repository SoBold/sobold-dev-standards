# Composer Packages

This page provides an overview of the Composer packages required for the [Core](/setup/core-profile) profile, especially for tasks like linting. These packages need to be installed globally to ensure proper functionality across all projects.

## PHPCS

The `phpcs` Composer package provides a coding standard tool for PHP, checking code for style violations using PHP_CodeSniffer. It helps enforce consistent code style across a project.

### Installation

To install `phpcs` globally run:

```sh
composer global require "squizlabs/php_codesniffer=*"
```

You can verify the installation by running:

```sh
phpcs -v
```

## Next steps

After installing the Composer packages, head over to the [dotfiles](/setup/dotfiles) page to configure and manage the necessary dotfiles.
