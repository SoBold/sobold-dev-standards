# PHP and Composer Installation and Configuration

## Introduction

This page provides instructions for installing and configuring PHP and Composer. Follow the steps according to your operating system.

## Install PHP

To install PHP, follow the instructions based on your operating system.

<Tabs items={['macOS', 'Windows']}>
    <Tabs.Tab label="macOS">
        ```sh
        brew install php
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab label="Windows">
        <Callout>
            **Thread Safe (TS)** is for multi-threaded servers, while **Non-Thread Safe (NTS)** is faster for non-threaded environments. As we only need php for Composer we won't need to worry about Thread Safety and can choose the Non-Thread Safe version
        </Callout>
        1. Visit [PHP for Windows](https://windows.php.net/download/).
        2. Download the latest stable version choosing Non-Thread Safe and choosing x86 or x64 depending on whether the system is 32-bit or 64-bit.
        3. Extract the zip file in `C:\php`.
        4. Add php directory to `PATH`.
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Install Composer

Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. To install Composer, follow the guide provided on the [Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

For manual installation through the command line, use:

<Tabs items={['macOS', 'Windows']}>
    <Tabs.Tab label="macOS">
        ```sh
        brew install composer
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab label="Windows">
        To install Composer on Windows, refer to the instructions on [Composer's installation page](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-windows).
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Verify Installation

Confirm that PHP and Composer are correctly installed by checking their versions. This ensures that the installation was successful and both tools are available for use.

```sh
php -v
```

```sh
composer -V
```
<Callout type="warning">
Note the capital `V` on `composer -V`
</Callout>

Both commands should output the version number of the corresponding tool.


## Core

This section provides an overview of the Composer packages required for the [Core](/setup/core-profile) profile, especially for tasks like linting. These packages need to be installed globally to ensure proper functionality across all projects. If you haven't completed the steps necessary to install PHP and Composer please go to the [top of the page](#introduction)

### PHPCS

The `phpcs` Composer package provides a coding standard tool for PHP, checking code for style violations using PHP_CodeSniffer. It helps enforce consistent code style across a project.

#### Installation

To install `phpcs` globally run:

```sh
composer global require "squizlabs/php_codesniffer=*"
```

To avoid having to define the global path of `phpcs` in VS Code settings, add %composer packages% it to your PATH.

For Windows this is in:
```sh
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Composer\vendor\bin
```

On macOS (and Linux)
- Prior to Composer 2.x:
```sh
~/.composer/vendor/bin
```
- Composer 2.x:
```sh
~/.config/composer/vendor/bin
```

You can verify the installation by running:

```sh
phpcs --version
```

### Next steps

Head back to the [Core page](/setup/core-profile/#prerequisites) to finish configuring the necessary prerequisites for Core Profile.
