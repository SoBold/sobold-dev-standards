# Core Profile

SoBold's Core Profile comes with an initial set of settings, extensions and snippets to help getting started on VS Code quickly.

## Prerequisites

### Fira Code

[Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) is a free monospaced font with programming ligatures.
As it is the chosen font for Core Profile, it'll have to be installed prior to activating the profile.

Visit [GitHub Fira Code page](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode?tab=readme-ov-file#download--install) and install the font folder, follow
the instructions for your operating system.

### Dotfiles

Certain extensions and packages require configuration files to function correctly. These files are usually included with every repository we use, but it's a good practice to keep a basic version of them in your ~ directory.
For more information on setting up these files, head over to the [Dotfiles page](/setup/dotfiles)."
