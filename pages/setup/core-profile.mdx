# Core Profile

SoBold's Core Profile comes with an initial set of settings, extensions and snippets to help getting started on VS Code quickly.

## Prerequisites

<Steps>
### Fira Code

[Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) is a free monospaced font with programming ligatures.
As it is the chosen font for Core Profile, it'll have to be installed prior to activating the profile.

Visit [GitHub Fira Code page](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode?tab=readme-ov-file#download--install) and install the font folder, follow
the instructions for your operating system.

<Callout type="info">
Core includes minimal ligatures by default, with options inspectable and testable using a [sample file](https://gist.github.com/2leonardo/1967f9203a80077f778464d5cc1b0db0).  Available ligatures are listed on the [GitHub Fira Code page.](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode?tab=readme-ov-file#whats-in-the-box)
</Callout>


### npm

Core profile requires specific npm packages to function correctly, particularly for linting. These packages should be installed globally to ensure consistent functionality. For more details on installation, visit the [npm page](/setup/npm#core).

### Composer

Core profile requires specific Composer packages to function correctly. For more details on installation, visit the [Composer page](/setup/composer#core).

### Dotfiles

Certain extensions and packages require configuration files to function correctly. These files are usually included with every repository we use, but it's a good practice to keep a basic version of them in your ~ directory.
For more information on setting up these files, head over to the [Dotfiles page](/setup/dotfiles).
</Steps>

## Activate Profile

To import and activate the Core profile, first access the Profiles editor. You can do this in one of the following ways:
- From the **File > Preferences > Profiles** menu.
- By clicking the **Manage profile** button in the bottom of the Activity Bar (represented by a gear icon if you're using the Default profile).

Next, select **Import Profile...** from the dropdown menu of the New Profile button.

When you select **Import Profile...**, an **Import Profile** dialog will appear, prompting you for the URL of a GitHub Gist or the file location of a profile.

Paste the GitHub Gist URL for the Core profile:
https://gist.github.com/2leonardo/7149dd63a32cc4da98125541653e51e9.

This will open the Profile creation form. Leave everything as is, and click **Create**.

## Profile Contents

### Settings

Core Profile doesn't introduce many changes to the settings, it mainly defines which linters to use and how they behave.

To inspect the settings file open the *Command Palette* `⌘+⇧+P` (`ctrl+⇧+P` on Windows) and search "**Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)**".
