# Overview

SoBold's PHP standards follow the official guide from [PHP-FIG](https://www.php-fig.org/)

## PSR-12

[PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) specification extends and replaces [PSR-2](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/), but requires adherence to [PSR-1](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/).

## SoBold's PHP standards

Our standards assume strict adherence to [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/), and in those cases where a rule is optional (e.g. when the guide mentions SHOULD instead of MUST), following the rule is advised.

### Additions

In our standards we have the following additions:

#### Arrow Functions

Arrow functions are not defined under PSR-12 convetions, however the style rules from [Operators](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/#6-operators) state:

> When space is permitted around an operator, multiple spaces MAY be used for readability purposes.

Following the style rules around spacing between the `function` keyword and its opening parenthesis, following the above quote  and borrowing example code from [Laravel Docs](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/collections#method-takeUntilTimeout), we'll conclude the following rule:

Arrow functions and its opening parenthesis MUST have one space.

```php
Invoice::pending()->cursor()
    ->each(fn ($invoice) => $invoice->submit());
```

#### Properties & Variables

[PSR-1 definition for properties](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/#42-properties) defines:

> This guide intentionally avoids any recommendation regarding the use of `$StudlyCaps`, `$camelCase`, or `$under_score` property names. Whatever naming convention is used SHOULD be applied consistently within a reasonable scope. That scope may be vendor-level, package-level, class-level, or method-level.

SoBold's PHP standards extend this definition and define the following rule:

Properties & Variables MUST be declared in `$camelCase`

```php
$some_variable = 10 // Incorrect
$someVariable = 10 // Correct
```
