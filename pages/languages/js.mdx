# Overview

SoBold's JS standards follow [Airbnb's Eslint base configuration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb-base). To enforce that, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) are used.

## Configuration

Our `.eslintrc.json`, at its simplest, is the following:

```json
{
    "extends": [
        "airbnb-base",
        "prettier"
    ],
    "rules": {
        "no-plusplus": 0,
        "no-use-before-define": [2, "nofunc"]
    }
}
```
Both Airbnb base and prettier are extended providing an inital set of rules.

<Callout type="info">
    Prettier actually turns off some rules, to avoid conflicts with Prettier, the code formatter.
</Callout>

Used in conjunction with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and with the related VSCode extensions,
this configuration ensures is both linted efficiently and formatted when completed.

## Changes

Our configuration modifies a few of the rules set by `airbnb-base`. These rules are:

- [`no-plusplus`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-plusplus) - `0` - Airbnb enables this rule marking plusplus usage as an error, unary operators (`++` and `--`) are subject to ASI (automatic semicolon insertion), however, using prettier makes sure that semicolon are always inserted, so any incorrect semicolon behaviour can be spotted earlier and corrected.

- [`no-restricted-syntax`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-restricted-syntax) - This rule is left untouched compared to airbnb's rules, `for..in` loops are disallowed as they introduce unexpected behaviour since they loop over the entire prototype chain.

- [`no-use-before-define`](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/no-use-before-define) - `[2, "nofunc"]` - This rule differs from airbnb's implementation as it allows usage of function calls before they're declared. Functions declarations (not expressions) are hoisted at the top of the file, so the usage is safe.
