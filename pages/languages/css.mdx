# Overview

SoBold's CSS standards are enforced with stylelint and extend:

- [`stylelint-config-standard-scss`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint-config-standard-scss)
- [`stylelint-config-idiomatic-order`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint-config-idiomatic-order).

## Config Standard SCSS

This configuration extends:

- `stylelint-config-standard` config and configures its rules for SCSS
- `stylelint-config-recommended-scss` config

The full list of rules can be found [here](https://github.com/stylelint-scss/stylelint-config-standard-scss/blob/HEAD/index.js).

## Config Idiomatic Order

This config enforces ordering based on [idiomatic css](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css#declaration-order).

The concept is that rules will have to be ordered based on their categorisation.
The three main categories are:

- Positioning - Every rule strictly related to positioning (e.g. `position`, `top|right|bottom|left`)

- Display & Box Model - Rules related to display & box model, box model refers to anything between padding to margin.

- Other - Any other rule that doesn't fit the above categories

<Callout type="info">
    Rules that affect any of the three axis are considered positioning rules (i.e. `z-index`)
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
    Box model have to be ordered from close to far, so padding first and margin last.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
    Typography rules should come after color rules.
</Callout>
