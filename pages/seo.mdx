## Project's Area of Influence

SEO information can be categorised by in which moment of the project it becomes relevant. The categories are:

- `planning`: Information is applied during the planning phase of the project and will influence certain choices
- `implementation`: Information is applied during the development phase, how certain blocks and features are coded will depend on what described here.
- `post`: Information is applied after the completion of the project.
