## Branches

Since we use a task management tool it makes creating a branch naming convention rather easy.\
When creating a new branch we should aim to follow this format:

```text
task/taskId
```

### Examples

```text
task/dev-10055
task/dev-9610
task/dev-8450
```

This allows for our task management tool to be referenced throughout our commit history.

## Commits

SoBold's commit standards adhere to the [Conventional Commits Specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

A commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
```

Commonly the commit type will be either `feat` or `fix`

- `feat` is a commit which introduces a new feature to the codebase.
- `fix` is a commit which introduces a fix which patches a bug in the codebase

There is also the `chore` type which is commonly used to 'bump' things.

### Examples

```text
feat: update link styling
feat(task/dev-9610): center content vertically
fix(index): cookie expire bug
```
